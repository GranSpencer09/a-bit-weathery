## Description

This website helps anyone who's wondering what the weather will be like in any city around the world. If they need forecast before visiting a city, or if they'd like to know what the current weather is they can use A-Bit-Weathery. This project also stores the cities a user searches for so they can easily access their weather data again. To build all of this, we of course need to pull data from the OpenWeather and OpenUV databases. We also used local storage to retain previous queries. During this project, I learned how to organize more complicated JS logic and construct a HTML outline that makes DOM manipulation easier. I created the outline in HTML and then removed those elements as I coded them in to appear with JS after a user's action.

## Installation

- Go to the code repo
- Located near the about section, find and press the green code button
- Copy either the HTTPS, Git CLI, download the zip, open with GitHub desktop, or copy the SSH link.
- Depending on download method, use Git or the desktop application to open the content files
- All of the content of the repository will be available after completion of the previous state.

## Usage

`md ![What's displayed after a user enters a city](./screen-shot) `
To use this, open the app and enter in a city under in the search bar and click 'search'. The user will immediately see the results. The current weather and the name of the city searched for appear at the top of the screen. Beneath this is the 5 day forecast for the city the user searched for. Finally, after the user searches for a city, a button with the name of that city appears beneath the search bar. If the user wants to check the weather in a city they've already searched for, they can click the button that's appeared to do so.

## Credits

The OpenWeather and OpenUV APIs were of course helpful. My tutor was also very helpful.
